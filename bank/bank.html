    <h1>COLUMBIA BANK</h1>
    <div class="columbia">
    <p>
        Well my recent project I was working with Columbia bank in New Jersey. It was an internal CRM project which basically facilitates the management to create a customer relationship and accounts, so that they can service them without transferring between the departments.

        The main scope of the project was that it was failing to deliver important information such as creating different pages for different module and had less interactive designed media icons. So, the Project was redesigned and enhanced and we also added few functionalities.

        UI technologies like HTML5, CSS3, bootstrap and JavaScript and
        Backend technologies like spring 3, hibernate and spring MVC framework.</p>

    <p>While I started off developing a SPA using Angular.JS with angular views using different controller so that when the user interacts with the button he would get required data. Which reduced the page load time and enhanced the user experience.

        The other end I had to create view segments and get the required data efficiently which was done using Angular directives like ng-view and Angular routing and services.

        I Used Restful web services to fetch the data of history of logged users where the data was stored in Mongo Db.</p>

        <p> The second development was done on the Internet banking where, the module in turn checks to verify how much funds the user transferred, within their checking and savings accounts, and then it debits the specified amount, and a message is generated.  So, transaction history reports of various customers were generated using Node.js

        To generate pie-charts for the data of various customers React.js was used to have a real time view.</p>

    <p>Backend technologies were used for creating secure login page, where I used spring security framework for all the employees to login and view data and basic server side validation was also done.

        To give the access to application for massive amount of data I used Hibernate.

        In this module backend logic layer was developed using spring 3 model view controller and it was integrated using hibernate to access Oracle 11g.


        Generated some charts using front-end visualization tool like jQuery Fusion Charts to represent the user expense graphically.

        Whenever the customer uses his debit card for transactions, the data will dynamically change the view of the charts to track the spending and saving, and get a real time view of net worth.

        Dynamically generated account statement reports using node JS framework.

        Other 3rd party jQuery plugins where used to make it more user friendly.</p>




       <p> Well when coming to testing and version controls:

        1)  GIT source version control tool was used for maintaining the code versions.
        2) Developed test cases following TDD and utilized Jasmine to write test cases and Karma to run them for frontend testing.
        3) Jenkins application server was used for continuous integration and continuous deployment.
        4) Used modernizer to check whether application is compatible with major browsers.
        5) The entire application was developed in agile scrum methodology.
