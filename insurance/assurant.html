<h1>ASSURANT INSURANCE</h1>
<div class="assurant">
    <p>My Second recent project was at Assurant is a leading insurance company in New York. They have wide range of various business services which include market insurance products in the property, casualty, life and health insurance sectors.


    </p>

    <p>Itâ€™s a Web based application which is used by the Insurance Agents to sell policies, process claims, and maintain the reports of the policy holder.

        The application also collects personal information of the customers for calculating and estimate the savings and give the eligibility which helps them to buy insurance plans.
    </p>

    <p> The customer can access complete account information where the customer can login and order for a policy, and generate Motor Vehicle Report (MVR), Claim, Endorsements for existing policies, and cancellation.

        The modules in which I was involved were Customer account management, Claim management, Claim documentation and Electronic submission module.

    </p>

    <p> A Single Page Application was developed using angular.JS which provides customer and insurance agents to access different insurance quotes. For example, the customer can add/edit the information given to get the new quote.

        Form validations were done for the basic personal info of the customers using JavaScript library like JQuery UI.

        I used CSS bootstrap library to create angular UI components such as drop down, tabs, collapse and carousel. CSS3 media queries were used for cross device compatibility.
</p>

    <p> This module included drop down menus for different kind of insurance like housing and lifestyle protection. Drop down menus were designed using REACT.js to get a quick update of the user profile.

        I implemented JQuery to simplify traverse between HTML documents, and also used Ajax to interact with the customer data page.

        I consumed JQuery AJAX calls to get the data from Restful API to show different insurance policies and update the content on UI and also used JQuery Ajax call to get review News, Legal Notices, and Policy Updates.


        For dynamic visualization chart I used JavaScript library like D3.js which gives a real time view of the different insurance claim settlement ratio for that fiscal year.

        Involved in Creating and Consuming Restful Services using Node.JS and Express.JS Framework for providing users with insurance plans on information like zip-code and state using jQuery.

        I used Ajax and JQuery to update the part of policy review pages.

        I used jQuery to validate sign in and registration forms, where file manipulation and file uploads were done using Node.js framework.

        Developed the Struts2 Server side & Client side validations using Actions errors and Validation rules.

        Implemented Hibernate 4 to interact with the MySQL database.

    </p>

    <p> 1)Handled cross-browser compatibility for Safari, Chrome, Firefox and IE using Modernizr.
        2) Involved in writing the Unit Test Cases using Jasmine and Q unit.
        3)Used SCRUM agile methodology for the software development in the SDLC (Scrum).
        4)Worked with source version control tool GIT to manage the code repository.
